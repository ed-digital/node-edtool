This tool automates the creation of new WordPress sites with ED. Digital's default plugins and theme. It's really only meant for ED. developers, but anyone is free to use it.

## Installation

Prerequisits and assumptions:

* A recent version of Node.js installed on your computer (v6.0+)
* Some kind of local web server (Apache, PHP, MySQL) â€” Try MAMP PRO or XAMPP on Mac.
* A default MySQL user account which has permission to create and manage databases
* Since we use MAMP PRO, we assume all sites will have a development domain, like `coolsite.dev` or something. You can achieve this manually by editing your `/etc/hosts` file... This is not covered by this guide or tool.

To install, open Terminal and type:

```
npm install -g ed-wp
ed
```

This will add a new command for you to run at any time, the `ed` command. Note that this will overwrite the 'ed' editor which ships with Mac OS and some Linux distributions.

Next, you'll want to create a configuration for your local machine. Make sure MySQL is already running, as it'll attempt to connect.

```
ed settings
```

And you're good to go!

## Creating a site

To create a new site, do something like the following:

```
cd ~/Sites/
ed create coolsite.dev
```

After answering each question carefully, the tool will begin downloading the required resources and creating your site. It may take a little time. At the end of the process, if successful, you'll be shown the URL, username and password for accessing your site.

**Don't forget** to create a new site in MAMP that points to the new folder!

You may still need to make some configuration changes to your new site after logging in:

* Under **Settings &gt; Permalinks** make sure 'Post name' is selected
* Under **Settings &gt; General**, make sure the title, tagline and timezone is correct
* Advanced Custom Fields does not activate automatically at this point.

## Navigation

Once a site has been created, you can jump to that projects theme folder from anywhere, by typing

```
ed go <project-slug>
```

For sites that were created manually, you can import them using:

```
cd <path-to-site>
ed scan
```

It'll ask you for a project name, and then you're all sorted ;) All it does is create an entry in `~/.ed/projects/`


## Development

Clone this project to your local machine and if you've installed node-edtool from npm, uninstall it now.
```
npm uninstall -g ed-wp
```

Make your changes locally then test by running:

```
npm install
npm link
```
