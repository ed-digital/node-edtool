# ED. Digital's WP Management Tool

This tool is meant to run on your local computer or dev site, rather than a production server.
It automates the creation of new WordPress sites with our default plugins. It's really only meant for ED. employees, but anyone is free to use it.

It uses our custom plugin and starting point theme.

## Installation

Prerequisits and assumptions:

* A recent version of Node.js installed on your computer (v6.0+)
* Some kind of local web server (Apache, PHP, MySQL) â€” Try MAMP PRO or XAMPP on Mac.
* A default MySQL user account which has permission to create and manage databases
* Since we use MAMP PRO, we assume all sites will have a development domain, like `coolsite.dev` or something. You can achieve this manually by editing your `/etc/hosts` file... This is not covered by this guide or tool.

To install, open Terminal and type:

```
npm install -g edtool
ed
```

This will add a new command for you to run at any time, the `ed` command. Note that this will overwrite the 'ed' editor which ships with Mac OS and some Linux distributions.

Next, you'll want to create a configuration for your local machine. Make sure MySQL is already running, as it'll attempt to connect.

```
ed settings
```

And you're good to go!

## Creating a site

To create a new site, do something like the following:

```
cd ~/Sites/
ed create coolsite.dev
```

After answering each question carefully, the tool will begin downloading the required resources and creating your site. It may take a little time. At the end of the process, if successful, you'll be shown the URL, username and password for accessing your site.

**Don't forget** to create a new site in MAMP that points to the new folder!

## Navigation

Once a site has been created, you can jump to that projects theme folder from anywhere, by typing

```
ed go <project-slug>
```

For sites that were created manually, you can import them using:

```
cd <path-to-site>
ed scan
```

It'll ask you for a project name, and then you're all sorted ;) All it does is create an entry in `~/.ed/projects/`
